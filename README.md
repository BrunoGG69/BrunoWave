   ` SONG_OUTPUT_PATH=<PATH>

This project development was **Aided** by AI tools, specifically:

* **GitHub Copilot:** For mild code suggestions.
* **ChatGPT:** For aiding in repetitive tasks and code cleanup. In this instance, it was used a little bit for the backend of the music player but most was made with the help of the resource mentioned above.

However, the design and implementation of the project are entirely original and based on the resources listed above.
